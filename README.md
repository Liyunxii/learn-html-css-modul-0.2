# 💅 Learn Basic CSS + HTML

Hi! I'm Raffida 👋  
This repo is my learning space to explore **Basic CSS styling** and a bit of **HTML structure** 💻✨  
Here I learned how to make web pages look more beautiful🩵   

---

## 🎯 Goal
To understand and practice the **fundamentals of CSS**, including:
- Internal CSS (using `<style>` tag)
- External CSS (linking `.css` file)
- Basic Selectors (Element, ID, Class)
- Text and Font styling
- Layout and alignment

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- The difference between **internal** and **external** CSS  
- How to connect an HTML file with a `.css` file  
- How to use **selectors** like `p`, `#id`, and `.class`  
- How to style text, set alignment, and choose fonts  
- That a little color (like `lightblue`) can change the whole vibe 🌈
